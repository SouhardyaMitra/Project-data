# [**Introduction**]{.underline}

#### *The project report titled "Analysis of Commercial Banks" delves into a comprehensive examination of the banking sector, a vital component of any economy. Over the specified project duration we aimed to assess the financial growth, identify localisation trends, explore expansion and explore locations of headquarters of the array of commercial banks. Utilizing a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, including the analysis of financial situations, market exposure and growth the study provides insights into the banks' financial health, market dynamics and motive. The report's significance lies in its potential to inform decision-making processes for common people, investors, and banking professionals, contributing to financial stability and the sustainable growth of the banking sector.*

#### *However the location of Headquarters of different banks also expresses the motive of establishment of the bank. However it is not necessary that all types of banks will show same trend.*

#### *Our aim was to find the financial conditions of the banks in terms of assets and revenues and exposure to market in terms of number of branches. In this project we've tried to find these using association between different factors like assets and revenues and using different plots to comprehensively analyse the current situation in terms of growth.*

# [**Motivation for doing this project**]{.underline}

#### We started this project with the general aim of obtaining the relationships between the geographical locations of headquarters of various types of banks. However in the process of the study we found some important insights like assets and revenues of public banks are much more higher than that of private sector banks and also the number of branches and revenue are positively associated etc. We believe that these factors are inter-dependent on each other in some way or another and that is what we wanted to answer through this project. While working on this, we came across various peculiar results which we will discuss later in the report.

# [**Data Collection Process**]{.underline}

### **Data Scraping :**

#### We've used web scraping to retrieve most part of our data. The site that we used was Wikipedia

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banks_in_India)

#### For the first three datasets, i.e. public_banks, private_banks, regional_rural_banks, all the variables except latitude and longitude, was obtained by web scraping. Latitude and longitude was manually taken from the website: [latlong](https://www.latlong.net/).

# [**Challenges faced while obtaining data**]{.underline}

#### While obtaining the data we faced certain challenges that took up much of our time. Some of these challenges were:

#### 1. While scraping data from wikipedia, some columns of the data contained hyperlinked information in the website and cleaning that data was a bit timetaking.

#### 2. Another issue that we faced during webscrapping was many columns like assets and revenues contains information in rupees unit as well as dollar unit. So cleaning that was also problematic as every cell contained both two types of information.

#### 3. While adding the 'Headquarters' column's location, we found that the site we used for it gives same coordinates for many banks in same region (mainly for mumbai area)

# [**Key Questions Of Interest**]{.underline}

### 1. *What is the reason behind the locational disparity between the headquarters of public sector banks, private sector banks and regional rural banks?*

### 2. *How the assets and revenues for public and private sector banks are distributed and what is the association between assets and revenues in each sector?*

### 3. *What is the reason behind so much difference in between assets and revenues of public and private sector banks?*

### 4. *What is the relation between Revenue and branches of a bank?*

# [**PUBLIC SECTOR BANKS**]{.underline}

Public Sector Banks are financial institutions where majority\[more than 50%\] of shares are held by Government.So,Government is responsible for the guidelines in these banks.

#### **Visualizing Government Shares**

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(shiny) 
library(ggplot2) 
library(leaflet) 
library(tidyr)

Public_Banks<-read.csv("public_banks.csv")

bank_name <- Public_Banks$Bank_name 
govt_share <- Public_Banks$Government..Shareholding

ggplot(Public_Banks, aes(x = bank_name, y = govt_share)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = bank_name, yend = 0, color = bank_name), size = 1) +
  xlab("Bank Name") +
  ylab("Government Shareholding (in %)") +
  ggtitle("Bank Name vs Government Shareholding") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = rainbow(length(unique(bank_name))))

```

#### **Obs**:  STATE BANK OF INDIA(S.B.I) a very well-known bank has least government shares in it.

\pagebreak

## Can we conclude more Branches implies more Revenue ?

#### **BRANCHES vs REVENUE**

-   Although,S.B.I has less branches comparatively with other public banks like Canara Bank,Union Bank etc..It has the highest revenue in India.
-   The plot provides relation between Number of Branches and Revenue in Public Sector Banks.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(Public_Banks) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Bank_name, y = Branches, fill = Headquarters), stat = "identity") +
  geom_line(aes(x = Bank_name, y = Revenues/100000, group = 2, color = "Revenue"), stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Bank Name", y = "Number of Branches", title = "Number of Branches in different banks",
       color = "Revenue ( in Cr)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = terrain.colors(length(unique(Public_Banks$Headquarters)))) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Revenue" = "red")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = Revenues, x = Bank_name, y = Revenues/100000))
```

\pagebreak

## **Private Sector Banks** {.underline}

Private sector banks are financial institutions that are owned and operated by private individuals or corporations, as opposed to being owned by the government. These banks are profit-oriented entities and function with the primary objective of maximizing shareholder value. Private sector banks play a crucial role in the overall banking and financial system of a country.


## [**Important Visualizations**]{.underline}

#### Comparision of Assets and Revenues of Private Sector Banks {.underline}

The following plot is showing the comparison between assets and revenues.

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
Private_Banks = read.csv("private_banks.csv")
Assets_Revenue =read.csv("Assets_Revenue.csv")

df_long <- pivot_longer(Private_Banks, cols = c(Total.Assets, Revenues), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value")

ggplot(df_long, aes(x = Bank_name, y = Value, fill = Variable)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Comparision of Assets with Revenues") +
  xlab("Bank_name") +
  ylab("Total.Assets / Revenues (in Cr)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Total.Assets" = "yellow", "Revenues"  = "green"))
```

The bar plot provides a visual comparison of the total assets and revenues of various private sector banks in India. By examining the heights of the bars for each bank, you can observe the relative magnitudes of total assets and revenues. This type of visualization is useful for quickly identifying banks that stand out in terms of their total assets and revenues and for understanding the distribution of these financial metrics across different banks. And finally we can visualize that private banks have more assets than revenues.

#### **Assets vs Revenue plot** {.underline}

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Assets_Revenue, aes(x = Total.Assets, y = Revenues, color = Bank_Type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  xlab("Total.Assets (in cr)") +
  ylab("Revenues (in cr)") +
  ggtitle("Total.Assets vs Revenues") +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = Bank_Type), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "blue")) 

```

From the plot we can visualize that there is a linear relationship between the assets and revenues of the private banks as well as the public banks. And the assets and revenues of public banks are much higher than the private banks.

#### **Branches of Private Sector Banks** {.underline}

```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,error=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Private_Banks) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Bank_name, y = Branches, fill = Headquarters), stat = "identity") +
  geom_line(aes(x = Bank_name, y = Revenues/10000, group = 2, color = "Revenue"), stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Bank Name", y = "Number of Branches", title = "Number of Branches in different banks",
       color = "Revenue ( in Cr)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = terrain.colors(length(unique(Private_Banks$Headquarters)))) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Revenue" = "red")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = Revenues, x = Bank_name, y = Revenues/10000))
```

HDFC bank, ICICI bank and Axis bank have higher number of branches across all over India. And the other remaining banks have much lesser number of branches across India.

## [**Regional Rural Banks**]{.underline}

Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) are financial institutions in India that were established with the goal of developing rural areas by providing credit and other financial services. RRBs were introduced based on the recommendations of the Narasimham Working Group in 1975 and were established under the Regional Rural Banks Act of 1976. These banks are jointly owned by the central government, the concerned state government, and the sponsoring commercial bank.

## **Number of branches of Regional Rural Banks**
